            Howdy there, folks!<br /><br />
            
            Last time I gave a brief description and some examples of the <b>module</b> 
            pattern, we went over basic concepts like <b>public</b> and <b>private</b> 
            members - and much fun was had by all!.<br /><br />
            
            You&#39;d think I&#39;d be satisfied...but I never am to be honest<br /><br />
            
            So let&#39;s dive into the <b>factory</b> pattern, it will literally make you a 
            more <i>productive</i> programmer! Oh LOL, etc!!!<br /><br />
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Why factory?</h2>
            
            <p>
            They say you should never judge a book by its cover, we can judge a design pattern 
            by it&#39;s name (sometimes), and the term <i>factory</i> is a descriptive one for 
            sure.<br /><br />
            
            In terms of prevalence the factory pattern might be right up there alongside our 
            old friend <b>module</b>, it&#39;s pretty ubiquitous in programming, but I&#39;ve 
            probably seen it used more in <b>JavaScript</b> than any other language. I recall 
            writing similar functions in c many moons ago, not even knowing at the time that 
            it was a bone-fide pattern. And you will find that often - you&#39;ll read up on 
            a particular pattern and realise you&#39;ve been using it all along...I love that!
            <br /><br />
            So what does the factory pattern <i>actually</i> do for us?<br /><br />
            </p>
            
            <h2>Creating new objects</h2>
            
            <p>
            First I think it&#39;s probably best that we swat up go over the concept of an 
            object. It ain&#39;t like <b>c++</b> or <b>php</b> where an object is an 
            instantiation of a class. Objects are <b>everywhere</b> in JavaScript, strings 
            are objects, numbers are objects, every-bloody-thing is an object. We use their 
            methods all the time without really caring:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaSript">
    // Methods, methods all over the place
    console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000).toString());
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            In the module pattern article we created a module that returned an <b>object 
            literal</b> -- essentially it&#39;s a collection of <b>properties</b> or comma-
            separated <i>key:value</i> pairs enshrined between a pair of <i>curly 
            braces</i>. The <b>key</b> is the property name we use to reference the property 
            <b>value</b>, example:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    var obj = {
        &quot;property_0&quot;: &quot;value 0&quot;,
        &quot;property_1&quot;: &quot;value 1&quot;
    };
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            Extremely simple example but makes a point. We can see that the properties are 
            separated by a <b>comma</b> and that the key and value fields of each property 
            are separated by a <b>colon</b>.<br /><br />
            
            So we can use the obj variable to access these properties thusly:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaSCript">
    console.log(obj.property_0);
    console.log(obj.property_1);
            </code></pre>
                
            <p>
            I'm not going to spend too much time going in deep on this, just want to make 
            sure we have some idea of what an object literal is. It&#39;s worth nothing, 
            however, that these <b>values</b> can be anything, a string, a number, an 
            array...another object or even a function! I honestly dunno why some people 
            are so down on JavaScript, I love this:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    var	obj = {
        &quot;a_num&quot;: 1234,
        &quot;a_string&quot;: &quot;&#39;allo M&#39;sieur!&quot;,
        &quot;an_array&quot;: [
            4321,
            &quot;Quell bitte, Madame!&quot;
            //
            // We could even put another array or object in here
            // if we want...unlimited pah-wah!
        ],
         &quot;an_object&quot;: {
            &quot;another_object&quot;: {
                &quot;another_array&quot;: [
                    &quot;you&quot;,
                    &quot;get&quot;,
                    &quot;the&quot;,
                    &quot;idea!&quot;
                ],
                &quot;even_more_stuff&quot;: &quot;some stuff&quot;
            }
        },
        &quot;even_a_function&quot;: function() {
            // Imagine we, like, created more objects in here!? Oh
            // my God, just like, you know...my head, can&#39;t...like,
            // you know -- literally, etc.
        }
    };
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            All very nice - these crazy objects can get quite complex, let me tell thee!
            <br /><br />
            You&#39;re probably bored with object literals, but there&#39;s more. A function 
            can be an object, in fact - the <b>closure</b> functions we saw in the <b>module 
            pattern</b> examples are objects. The module pattern basically returns an object 
            with <b>private</b> and <b>public</b> properties and methods.
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaSript">
    function someObject() {
        // The <b>let</b> keyword is like <b>var</b> only let will
        // ensure the declared value is only available within
        // the scope of the function/object
        //
        // No more tangents...Google it!
        //
        let	hide_me = &quot;Private property&quot;;
                    
        // We can use the <i>mystical</i> <b>this</b> keyword to define
        // public values...yeah, we don&#39;t <b>need</b> to be modular
        // and return public properties/methods in an object!
        //
        this.show_me = &quot;Public property&quot;;
    }
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            So how do we use ths? Notice that it isn&#39;t a <b>closure</b>, so it is not one 
            of those immediately invoked functions we read about. So it&#39;s not a closure, 
            what we really have here is a kind of <b>class</b> (strictly <b>not</b> a class, 
            but why so pedantic?) or maybe a better description is a <b>blueprint</b>. We can 
            use it to create objects which will have their own individual set of properties 
            and methods.<br /><br />
            
            We take that blueprint and we say, hey...JavaScript, gimme a <i>new</i> 
            <b>instance</b> of this <b>blueprint</b>. We can build the same thing a 
            million times if we have the blueprint...so we can make as many of these 
            <b>objects</b> as we like. To do this we need the <i>infamous</i> <b>new</b> 
            keyword:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    // Hey JavaSript! Gimmie a new...umm...someObject?
    //
    var	obj = new someObject();
                
    console.log(&quot;Why bother? We know it won&#39;t work: &quot; + obj.hide_me);
    console.log(&quot;Pretty sure this will work: &quot; + obj.show_me);
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            Now again, I ain&#39;t going in all deep on this, just another tangent. We will 
            see more complex examples of <i>this type of thing</i> as we grow older and become 
            wiser.<br /><br />
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>So what about the factories?</h2>
            
            <p>
            I came up with a rather absurd but hopefully interesting example to help illustrate 
            this admittedly simple concept. Let us imagine that we own this an actual factory 
            and it produces people. Actual, living people being churned out by some production 
            line. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s like, some maniac out there who would really love 
            to own a business like this, let&#39;s imagine we are that despotic individual.<br /><br />
            
            We hire someone to build us our blueprint that we can use to define any type of 
            person. With this blueprint we can produce person after person after person...
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    function person() {
        // Let*#39;s randomly pick a sex, 0 for male, 1 for female...
        let	sex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);            
        let	age = 0;
    }
                
    // Jus&#39; churnin&#39; out them people!
    //
    var	a_person = new person();
    var	another_person = new person();
                
    // Whooooa!
    //
    var	twins = [
        new person(),
        new person()
    ];
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            Mr factory man decides he&#39;s fed up with all the babies occupying the shelves of 
            his <b>person shop</b>, so he decides to alter the <b>person()</b> blueprint so that 
            he can create people of any age:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    function person(set_age_to) {
        // Let&#39;s randomly pick a sex, 0 for male, 1 for female...
        let	sex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);            
        let	age = set_age_to;
    }
                
    // Create a 25 year old new-born baby.
    //
    var	baby = person(25);
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            Cool, so every time we create a person from this blueprint we get an individual 
            object with its own set of properties and even methods. Let&#39;s imagine 
            that Mr factory man, high on his own maniacal sense of power, decides that he 
            should be able to change the age of an already living person. He really is nuts, 
            that guy:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    function person(set_age_to) {
        // Let&#39;s randomly pick a sex, 0 for male, 1 for female...
        let	sex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);            
        let	age = set_age_to;
                
        // Let&#39;s use <b>this</b> to create some public methods, first
        // the method to the persons name..
        this.setAge = function(set_age_to) {
            age = set_age_to;
        };
                    
        // Public member to show age.
        this.getAge = function() {
            return age.toString();
        }
    }
            
    // Create a 50 year old.
    //
    var new_dude = new person(50);
                
    // Then rob him of 25 years of what short life he has
    // left for a laugh!
    //
    new_dude.setAge(75);
                
    // What age is this &quot;new_dude&quot;?
    //
    console.log(new_dude.getAge());
    // Oh my!
            </code></pre>
            
            <h2>Michael -- you are still going on about objects!</h2>
            
            <p>
            I know. About the factories - we already sort of have one, we have this blueprint 
            and we can churn out people, even set their age.<br /><br />
            
            What we can do next is write another function... a factory function that will 
            produce these nifty little objects for us. The factory pattern is exactly that 
            and you&#39;re probably already thinking of ways you can achieve this.<br /><br />
            
            If you&#39;re already trying to write one then you&#39;re on the right track, 
            the concept itself is expressive enough to tell us most of what we want to know. 
            One of the things people like about churning out the objects in this way is we 
            cut out that <i>pesky</i> <b>new</b> keyword...lot o&#39; folk don&#39;t like it 
            simply because they long for more traditional <b>OOP</b> constructs and paradigms 
            like what you&#39;d find in php...I say, go...go use php then! Sa-mattaaaaa-wit-
            yaaaaa?<br /><br />
            
            Yeah, these factories can be very useful, and may even be seen forming part of a 
            larger pattern. Here is a simple example of a factory that will pump out the people 
            for ol&#39; Mr factory face over there:
            </p>
            
            <pre><code class="JavaScript">
    // Our (modified) person() blueprint.
    //
    function person(set_age_to) {
        var	age = set_age_to;
                    
        // This time we will have a private method so that
        // Mr factory man can have his fun changing peoples
        // ages.
        //
        var setAge = function(set_age_to) {
            age = set_age_to;
        };   
                    
        // We could do the old <b>this</b> thing to declare our
        // private members, but we like this little pattern.
        //
        // By we I mean me...and me.
        //
        return {
            // And reveal a public option that calls the
            // private method directly
            &quot;setAge&quot;: setAge,
                            
            // Let&#39;s have another public method that
            // reveals the age to us
            &quot;getAge&quot;: function() {
                return age.toString();
            }
        }
    };
                           
    // Now here&#39;s the factory...
    //
    function newPerson(set_age_to) {
        // The person() object expects the set_age_to
        // parameter.
        //
        // The newPerson() function does not! It can be
        // omitted. If it is, we&#39;ll set it to default 0
        if (typeof(set_age_to) === &quot;undefined&quot;)
            var	set_age_to = 0;
                
        // All good, return the new person!
        return new  person(set_age_to);
    }
                
    // It has never been easier!
    //
    var	him = newPerson();
    var	her = newPerson(5);
    var	they = newPerson(0);
    var	zir = newPerson(15);
    var	ze = newPerson(0);
    var	etc = newPerson(65536);
                
    // Let&#39;s just check it's all working fine..
    //
    console.log(&quot;Age of him is &quot; + him.getAge());
    console.log(&quot;Age of her is &quot; + her.getAge());
    console.log(&quot;Age of they is &quot; + they.getAge());
    console.log(&quot;Age of zir is &quot; + zir.getAge());
    console.log(&quot;Age of ze is &quot; + ze.getAge());
    console.log(&quot;Age of etc is &quot; + etc.getAge());

            <p>
            Hopefully you can clearly see the benefits of using a pattern like this -- even 
            with such a simple example. The factory function can make decisions based on 
            parameters given, create, modify and then return the <b>new</b> object for us. 
            And check out the familiar old <i>revealing</i> mechanism, returning the object 
            literal with some <b>public</b> members.
            <br /><br />
            Tasty, eh? <br /><br />
            </p>
            
            
            <h2>Over-due conclusion:</h2>
            
            <p>
            Factory is fairly simple but absolutely worth knowing, this is a basic example. 
            Best thing to do is go out and tinker, try things. I&#39;ve gone off on some 
            rather odd tangents in this episode. We explored a few little areas...just enough 
            to <i>whet your whistle</i> as they used to say but hopefully someone is learning 
            something.<br /><br />
            
            If you&#39;re new to the factory pattern and you&#39;re a bit like me you&#39;ll 
            immediately be thnking of all the wonderful things you can do with this pattern. You 
            will see it a lot, and you&#39;ll probably use it a lot, too.<br /><br />
            
            Maybe try extending the person() object to store other properties, name, number of 
            legs, arms, heads, etc. Try stuff!<br /><br />
